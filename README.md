## Description

An application that allows us to create  and store passwords for various accounts.
Password Locker stores a user's password for their various accounts. It also allows the user to generate random password and various credentials and stores them. This ensures that a user's password is strong enough and stored safely for easy retrieval.

## User Specifications

* I will have to Sign Up in order to login
* To create a password locker account with my details - log in and password
* Store my existing login credentials. For example, I would want to store my twitter account credentials.
